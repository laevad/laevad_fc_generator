The Flutter Clean Architecture Code Generator is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of creating Flutter projects following the Clean Architecture principles. Clean Architecture enhances maintainability and scalability by structuring your codebase into well-defined layers.

## Basis

This code generator is built on the foundation of the [Flutter Clean Architecture](https://github.com/laevad/flutter_clean_architecture) philosophy. Clean Architecture divides an application into distinct layersâ€”Domain, Data, and Presentationâ€”each with its own responsibilities. The generator takes this philosophy further by automating the creation of this architecture in your Flutter projects.

## Why I Created This

Developing applications using Clean Architecture can be time-consuming due to the manual setup required for adhering to the architecture's principles. I created this code generator to address this challenge. With automated project generation and layer setup, developers can kickstart their projects while focusing more on feature development rather than architecture scaffolding.


## Features

- **Automated Project Setup**: Generate a new Flutter project with a Clean Architecture structure effortlessly.
- **Layer Separation**: Establish clear boundaries between Domain, Data, and Presentation layers for better code organization.
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Save time by generating the initial code for different layers, allowing you to focus on implementing features.
- **Customizable Templates**: Tailor templates to fit your specific project requirements.
- **Follow Clean Architecture**: Explore the generated project structure and utilize the Clean Architecture principles in your development process.

## More Info/Documentation (Coming Soon)

Stay tuned for more comprehensive documentation and resources that will help you make the most out of the Flutter Clean Architecture Code Generator. The following content is in the works:

- Detailed usage examples for different use cases.
- Explanations of the generated code and how it aligns with Clean Architecture principles.
- Best practices for customizing the templates and configurations to match your project's requirements.
- Troubleshooting guides to address common issues and challenges.

The goal is to provide you with the resources you need for a smooth experience when using this code generator.
